### Templates

All templates from this repository come as part of the [Amido.Stacks.CQRS.Templates](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Amido.Stacks.CQRS.Templates/) NuGet package. The list of templates inside the package are as follows:

- `stacks-cqrs-webapi`. The full CQRS template including source + build infrastructure.
- `stacks-add-cqrs`. A special template that can add `CQRS` functionality and projects to your existing Web API solution

### Template usage

#### Template installation

For the latest template version, please consult the Nuget page [Amido.Stacks.CQRS.Templates](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Amido.Stacks.CQRS.Templates/). To install the templates to your machine via the command line:

```shell
dotnet new --install Amido.Stacks.CQRS.Templates
```

The output will list all installed templates (not listed for brevity). In that list you'll see the two installed Amido Stacks templates listed above.

```shell
Template Name                                         Short Name                       Language    Tags

Amido Stacks CQRS Projects                            stacks-add-cqrs                  [C#]        Stacks/CQRS
Amido Stacks CQRS Web API                             stacks-cqrs-webapi               [C#]        Stacks/Infrastructure/CQRS/WebAPI
...

Examples:
    dotnet new mvc --auth Individual
    dotnet new react --auth Individual
    dotnet new --help
```

#### Uninstalling a template

To uninstall the template pack you have to execute the following command

```shell
dotnet new --uninstall Amido.Stacks.CQRS.Templates
```

#### Important parameters

- **-n|--name**
  - Sets the project name
  - Omitting it will result in the project name being the same as the folder where the command has been ran from
- **-d|--domain**
  - Sets the name of the aggregate root object. It is also the name of the collection within CosmosDB instance.
- **-db|--database**
  - Configures which database provider to be used.
- **-o|--output**
  - Sets the path to where the project is added
  - Omitting the parameter will result in the creation of a new folder

#### Creating a new WebAPI + CQRS project from the template

Let's say you want to create a brand new WebAPI with CQRS for your project.

It's entirely up to you where you want to generate the WebAPI. For example your company has the name structure `Foo.Bar` as a prefix to all your namespaces where `Foo` is the company name and `Bar` is the name of the project. If you want the WebAPI to have a domain `Warehouse`, use `CosmosDb` and be generated inside a folder called `new-proj-folder` you'll execute the following command:

```shell
% dotnet new stacks-cqrs-webapi -n Foo.Bar -d Warehouse -db CosmosDb -o new-proj-folder
The template "Amido Stacks Web Api" was created successfully.
```

#### Adding a CQRS template to your existing solution

Let's say you have a WebAPI solution and you want to add CQRS functionality to it.

In order for the template to generate correctly you'll need to execute it in the folder where your `.sln` file is located. Also for the purposes of this example we're assuming that in your solution the projects and namespaces have `Foo.Bar` as a prefix.

```shell
% cd src

% dotnet new stacks-add-cqrs -n Foo.Bar.CQRS -d Menu
The template "Amido Stacks Web Api CQRS - Add to existing solution" was created successfully.
```

If all is well, in the output you'll see that projects are being added as references to your `.sln` file. The list of projects that you'll get by installing this template are as follows (please note the prefix provided with the `-n` flag from above):

- Foo.Bar.CQRS.Infrastructure
- Foo.Bar.CQRS.API
- Foo.Bar.CQRS.API.Models
- Foo.Bar.CQRS.Application.CommandHandlers
- Foo.Bar.CQRS.Application.Integration
- Foo.Bar.CQRS.Application.QueryHandlers
- Foo.Bar.CQRS.Domain
- Foo.Bar.CQRS.Common
- Foo.Bar.CQRS.CQRS
- Foo.Bar.CQRS.Common.UnitTests
- Foo.Bar.CQRS.CQRS.UnitTests
- Foo.Bar.CQRS.Domain.UnitTests
- Foo.Bar.CQRS.Infrastructure.IntegrationTests

As you see you get a new `Foo.Bar.CQRS.API` folder which has controllers wired up with the CQRS command handlers. If you had provided `-n Foo.Bar` as your name in the command above you would get an error stating the following:

```shell

Rerun the command and pass --force to accept and create.
```

This will happen if the newly generated template project names collide with your existing structure. It's up to you to decide if you want to use the `--force` flag and overwrite all collisions with the projects from the template. By doing so you might lose your custom logic in some places and you'll have to transfer things manually to the new projects by examining the diffs in your source control.

If you don't want to do that you can generate the new projects with a different namespace (what was shown above) and then copy/remove the things you don't need.
